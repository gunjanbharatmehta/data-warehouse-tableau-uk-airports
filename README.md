# UK Airports Punctuality Data Warehouse and Tableau Analysis

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the UK Airports Punctuality Data Warehouse and Tableau Analysis project. This project focuses on utilizing a data warehouse and Tableau to analyze punctuality statistics for selected UK airports. The dataset consists of 12 files, each representing a month of data from the year 2021.

## Project Overview

This project explores how the provided dataset can be used for research purposes by leveraging a data warehouse and Tableau. The goal is to demonstrate the benefits of building a data warehouse, design a star schema for the data, create necessary tables, discuss data preparation and transformation steps, highlight the advantages of OLAP cubes in the airline industry, and showcase the benefits of combining a data warehouse with Tableau for business intelligence.

## Report Tasks

The project is divided into several tasks, each with specific objectives. Here is a summary of the tasks conducted:

1. **Building a Data Warehouse** - Discusses the benefits of constructing a data warehouse for the provided dataset, emphasizing the advantages of centralized data storage, improved data quality, enhanced data analysis capabilities, and streamlined reporting processes.

2. **Designing a Data Warehouse** - Presents a star schema design for the data warehouse, justifying the design decisions made. This includes identifying the fact and dimension tables, determining primary and foreign keys, and establishing relationships between tables.

3. **CREATE Table Statements** - Provides the CREATE table statements for each table in the star schema, including primary and foreign keys. This step ensures the necessary table structures are defined for storing and organizing the data effectively.

4. **Data Preparation and Transformation** - Describes the steps taken to create and populate the database, focusing on data preparation and transformation tasks. This includes data cleaning, data integration from the 12 monthly files, data normalization, and any necessary data quality checks.

5. **Benefits of OLAP Cubes in the Airline Industry** - Explores how the airline industry can benefit from OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) cubes. Provides examples of OLAP cubes relevant to the industry and discusses their advantages in terms of multidimensional analysis, rapid data exploration, and decision-making support.

6. **Benefits of Data Warehouse and Tableau** - Discusses the advantages of using a data warehouse in conjunction with a business intelligence tool like Tableau. Highlights benefits such as improved data visualization, interactive dashboards, self-service analytics, and enhanced data-driven decision-making capabilities.

7. **Tableau Visualizations** - Creates visualizations using Tableau and presents them in the report. For each visualization, includes the aim, steps taken to create it, and key findings derived from the visualization. This allows for effective data exploration and communication of insights.

8. **Conclusion** - Provides a concluding section summarizing the project's key findings, emphasizing the value of utilizing a data warehouse and Tableau for analyzing punctuality statistics in the UK airports. This section may also include suggestions for further research or potential areas of improvement.
